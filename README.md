is a digital common space, knowledge-base, and tool-kit for people that either live in nature, are striving to go back to nature, strive to protect those people, make tools to aid these people... // Wherever you were born, whatever your culture, whatever your history, you know the right way to live: with nature. It's for people that live a slow life, living and learning at the pace of plants, growing with them, dying with them, only to be reborn again and again, changing one's self entirely several times, as we get closer to nature.

The Way of Nature's Guardians provides a digital common space for people that either live in nature or are striving to go back to nature. It's also a place for the people that strive to protect those people. It's also a place for people that make tools (digital or not) to aid these people.

Now, obviously, most of those people don't use Discord, or speak English, or think anywhere near the way I am currently thinking as i write this.., so this is likely a space for people who have lived in both cultures/worlds/mind-sets: indgenous / in nature and with technology ("developed" and "undeveloped"). Very likely, it's people that either migrated from the technological world to nature or from nature to the technological world. It's for the unique grassroots communities 'n their communes in nature ("intentional communities") around the world. But... it sure would be nice to somehow stop *a billion* people from using corporate-owned social media (especially Baidu, LINE, Kakao Talk) and use decentralized messaging, or even just Discord! :/

It's up to us to make a digital world that fits our own worlds, in the languages we live. I personally have a set of tool ideas to aid nomads, anarchists, homeless peopels, buskers, street-vendors, garderners, farmers, people living in nature: us. We need to survive. We need power. We need tools, technologies, 'n techniques.

I wonder: what other people out there, in some remoate area in the world, may be up to...

#### notes
i think there will be a divide between the intellectual part of this: theories ,etc., and the practical side of this: permaculture / self-reliance. It might be better to divide the two since you don't have to have eco-feminist values to live in nature, and you don't have to have back-to-nature values to be eco-feminist (or do you?...).

todo:  
need a less generic title

cut:  
...At the moment, there's nothing else on this web-site. Soon it will become a knowledge-base. And hopefully after that, 
I'll add some tools for the people to use!
