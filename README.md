# natureâ€™s guardians: *the natural way* of life: a back-to-nature / permaculture digital communal space
is a project and digital communal space for passionate people that either: follows nature's way of life, strives to go back to nature, strives to protect all beings that follow nature, make tools or ideas or new ways to aid all beings to stick to the path, or would love to follow nature's way but can't because of circumstances, 'n so on; constantly struggling to find ways to survive against civilization: indigenous, migrants, minorities, outcasts, hippies: *real* people

Wherever you were born, whatever your culture, whatever your history, you know the right way to live: with nature, *slowly* and *carefully*. It's for people that live a slow life, living and learning at the pace of plants, growing with them, dying with them, only to be reborn again and again, changing one's self entirely several times, as we get ever closer to nature.

## a q&a site?
there seems to be [a q&a stack exchange site on sustainability](https://sustainability.stackexchange.com), but it's pretty terrible. It doesn't have any females, and certainly no non-English speakers. It's composed of rich idiots still focused on recycling and solar panels, not going any further. The gardening stack exchange site probably has more diversity... as should the community-building site... but the problem is that they try to seperate what cannot be seperated: life.

For that reason, most questions are asked on Facebook groups (local, provincial, national), or places that feel a little more social. There are many Facebook groups for farmers and organic farmers. They're all more visual people, posting photos, and not much else. They are focused on the world, not the screen... It would be diffiuclt to get those people...

Language is a another problem with Q&A sites, or any written-medium sites (forums, chats, etc.)... I don't see why though, as Google should e able to translate posts...

Hrm...

**a q&a site for ecofeminism, however, would be rad! :o** That, i think could build a central body of knowledge...
  - proposing to the main stackexchange site basically requires you to have a community of people that are already into it... it's quite a commitment really... you need people to moderate and edit...
  - stackexchange doesn't seem to give their software for private use, only some shit enterprise version made catered to dev teams
  - https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2267/are-there-any-clones-alternatives-for-running-a-stack-exchange-style-qa-site
    - lists good alternatives
    - https://codidact.com seems cool, as it already has sites for cooking and outdoors
      - ...but again, it just feels a bit inhumane... but maybe it's supposed to? Facebook groups now have search functions, which sorta make them useful...

# another writing
The Way of Nature's Guardians provides a digital common space for people that either live in nature or are striving to go back to nature. It's also a place for the people that strive to protect those people. It's also a place for people that make tools (digital or not) to aid these people.

Now, obviously, most of those people don't use Discord, or speak English, or think anywhere near the way I am currently thinking as i write this.., so this is likely a space for people who have lived in both cultures/worlds/mind-sets: indgenous / in nature and with technology ("developed" and "undeveloped"). Very likely, it's people that either migrated from the technological world to nature or from nature to the technological world. It's for the unique grassroots communities 'n their communes in nature ("intentional communities") around the world. But... it sure would be nice to somehow stop *a billion* people from using corporate-owned social media (especially Baidu, LINE, Kakao Talk) and use decentralized messaging, or even just Discord! :/

It's up to us to make a digital world that fits our own worlds, in the languages we live. I personally have a set of tool ideas to aid nomads, anarchists, homeless peopels, buskers, street-vendors, garderners, farmers, people living in nature: us. We need to survive. We need power. We need tools, technologies, 'n techniques.

I wonder: what other people out there, in some remoate area in the world, may be up to...

#### notes
i think there will be a divide between the intellectual part of this: theories ,etc., and the practical side of this: permaculture / self-reliance. It might be better to divide the two since you don't have to have eco-feminist values to live in nature, and you don't have to have back-to-nature values to be eco-feminist (or do you?...).

todo:  
need a less generic title

cut:  
...At the moment, there's nothing else on this web-site. Soon it will become a knowledge-base. And hopefully after that, 
I'll add some tools for the people to use!
